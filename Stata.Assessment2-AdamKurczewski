save deceased

*save children

* Note: things i need to learn/wish I knew - how to work with multiple
* datasets in stata without needing to combine into one.  Comfortable with this in 
* R but not here..

* Variables lost are common variables

** Part 1: Describe **
**********************

tab lived_unit
label list irh15_u

* creating standardized metric to base length of life off of
gen days_lived = .
replace days_lived = lived*1440 if lived_unit == 1
replace days_lived = lived*24 if lived_unit == 2
replace days_lived = lived if lived_unit == 3
replace days_lived = 30/lived if lived_unit == 4
replace days_lived = 365/lived if lived_unit == 5

*subsetting to only include households with a child who died before 1 year
drop if days_lived > 365

* comparing the duration of life for deaths occurring 28 days or less after birth
* to those who died within one year
kdensity days_lived if days_lived <= 28
kdensity days_lived if days_lived > 28

/*
Now that the data is subset to the observations of interest, all descriptive efforts
will satisfy the prompt/facilitate the comparison between households that experienced 
infant death within the first 28 days and households experiencing infant death within 
the first year.  Note: there is the potential for "double counting" here so further
subsetting is necessary when describing households with deaths in the first year
*/

* summary of physical hh characteristics as well as hh size and days infant lived
* summarizes for households with an infant mortality occuring 1 year or less after birth
summarize days_lived hh_size ib3.insurance i.drinking_water i.floor i.wall i.roof, sep(0) base

* for reference
label list yesno rkr04 rkr03 rkr02 rkr01





*******************
** Part 2: Story **
*******************


/*
** Comparing roof material across the two groups of interest

tab roof if days_lived <= 28
tab roof if days_lived > 28

graph hbar days_lived if days_lived <= 28, over(roof)
graph hbar days_lived if days_lived > 28 & days_lived if days_lived <= 28, over(roof)
*/

*binary variable to ID households with an infant death in the first 28 days 
*vs within the first year
gen early_death = 0
replace early_death = 1 if days_lived > 28
label define earlydeath 1 "Death in first year" 0 "Death within first 28 days"
label value early_death earlydeath 

* removing odd '7' category w/ 14 obs - not enough to worry about in this context
* however, more formal analysis, it would be a good idea to track down why 7 was entered
* and if it was a mistake, an encoding error, or missing data.
* similar reasoning for drinking_water '9'
drop if roof == 7
drop if drinking_water == 9
