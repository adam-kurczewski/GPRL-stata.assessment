tostring id_household, replace
save deceased

use "C:\Users\kurczew2\Desktop\GPRL\Data\Part 2\household-13.dta", clear
save household

*tostring id_household, replace
*save children

* Note: things i need to learn/wish I knew - how to work with multiple
* datasets in stata without needing to combine into one.  Comfortable with this in 
* R but not here..

* Variables lost are common variables
joinby id_household using deceased

** Part 1: Describe **
**********************

tab lived_unit
label list irh15_u

* creating standardized metric to base length of life off of
gen days_lived = .
replace days_lived = lived*1440 if lived_unit == 1
replace days_lived = lived*24 if lived_unit == 2
replace days_lived = lived if lived_unit == 3
replace days_lived = 30/lived if lived_unit == 4
replace days_lived = 365/lived if lived_unit == 5

*subsetting to only include households with a child who died before 1 year
drop if days_lived > 365

* comparing the duration of life for deaths occurring 28 days or less after birth
* to those who died within one year
kdensity days_lived, xline(28)

*kdensity days_lived if days_lived <= 28
*kdensity days_lived if days_lived > 28

/*
Note: there is the potential for "double counting" here when comparing
the two different timeframes for infanct mortality, so further
subsetting is necessary when describing households with deaths in the first year
*/

* summary of physical hh characteristics as well as hh size and days infant lived
* summarizes for households with an infant mortality occuring 1 year or less after birth
summarize days_lived hh_size ib3.insurance i.drinking_water i.floor i.wall i.roof, sep(0) base

* for reference
label list yesno rkr04 rkr03 rkr02 rkr01



*******************
** Part 2: Story **
*******************

* investigating simple correlations between variables of interest and days lived
global controls hh_size ib3.insurance i.drinking_water i.floor i.wall i.roof


*binary variable to ID households with an infant death in the first 28 days 
*vs within the first year
gen early_death = 0
replace early_death = 1 if days_lived > 28
label define earlydeath 1 "After 28 days" 0 "Before 28 days"
label value early_death earlydeath 

* learning on the fly - using catplot to create nicer categorical graph comparisons
* resourse-https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/stata_bar_graphs.htm
ssc install catplot

catplot floor early_death, ///
var1opts(label(labsize(small))) ///
var2opts(label(labsize(small))) ///

catplot wall early_death, ///
var1opts(label(labsize(small))) ///
var2opts(label(labsize(small))) ///

* removing odd '7' category w/ 14 obs - not enough to worry about in this context
* however, more formal analysis, it would be a good idea to track down why 7 was entered
* and if it was a mistake, an encoding error, or missing data.
* similar reasoning for drinking_water '9'
drop if roof == 7
drop if drinking_water == 9

* regression analsysis
reg days_lived $controls, cluster(id_household)

* effects on "early death" mortality
reg days_lived $controls if days_lived <= 28, cluster(id_household)

*subset data to avoid double counting for "late death" 
reg days_lived $controls if days_lived > 28, cluster(id_household)


**************************
*** Concluding Remarks ***
**************************

/*
primary resources utilized were the stata internal support documents.  
I also utilized the statalist forum for guidance on specific analysis.
Finally, I referenced 1 problem set completed as coursework as a requirement
for my masters program and another set of code that I worked on as a member
of a data cleaning team.  The data is being used in my thesis research and was
worked on by 2 other members of my cohort.  I have included both documents in 
the github repository shared with the interviewers!
